# WinVICE-plus

WinVICE+ is based on VICE 3.2, the last official version that included WinVICE.</br>

It aims to integrate the developments of vanilla VICE without removal of the native UI for Windows.</br>

Further goals are fixes for long-standing problems (e.g. sound at 50 Hz refresh rate),</br>
new features (e.g. autofire lock) and integration of improvements from other developers.</br>

Downloadable binary distributions will make it easy for users who cannot or do not want to compile their own customized WinVICE,</br>
but still want to use a newer and more feature-rich version with the native UI.
